# Use the official Nginx image from the Docker Hub
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy your static site files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS) into the container
# COPY ./static-site /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 for the web server
EXPOSE 80

# No CMD required as the Nginx image already has the default command to run the server
